## Project 4: Data Lake

### Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using a Spark cluster on AWS, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

While it's possible to process the entire dataset with Spark on a local machine, this will take a long time because the data needs to go from S3 to the local machine, and then back to S3, which incurs a lot of network overhead. The advantage of deploying a spark cluster on AWS EMR is that we can take advantage of parallel processing on a cluster of machines with minimized network overhead since the data transfer is all within AWS us-west-2 region.

During the development phase, I tested a local spark cluster with a small subset of the data to make sure that everything works as it should.  Once this is done, I will then run it on the full dataset in AWS EMR.

In order to process the full dataset with Spark, an EMR cluster with the following specification was created using awscli in the command prompt:
- Release emr-5.31.0
- Loaded applications: Spark 2.4.6 on Hadoop 2.10.0 YARN and Zeppelin 0.8.2, Jupyter Lab
- Instance type m5.xlarge
- Number of instances: 3

The output from the spark cluster is in the form of parquet files for each of the analytics tables and loaded back to my own S3 bucket residing in us-west-2.

### Project Files

* `etl.py`  reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
* `dl.cfg` file containing AWS credentials used for project development
* `README.md` provides relevant project information

To run the program from the command line with Python installed, use the following:
`python etl.py`

### Project Datasets

The two datasets that reside in S3 with links to each below:

    Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
    Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
    
#### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

#### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, the following star-schema was created for songplay analysis with the tables listed below. 

Fact Table

    1. songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
        songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

Dimension Tables

    2. users - users in the app
        user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    3. songs - songs in music database
        song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    4. artists - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
    5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

#### Sample Queries

The following sample queries are included in this project:

* Row counts for `songs_table`, `artists_table`, `users_table`, `time_table`, and `songplays_table`
* Show top 5 rows of each of the tables above
* User songplays query showing columns from all 5 tables, with songs that have been played by individual users at a given time
